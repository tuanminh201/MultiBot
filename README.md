# MultiBot
A multifunctional Bot

Hi, this is my Discord bot I made for my own server using Discord.py


To Start you first need to install discord.py by typing this in cmd : py -3.6 -m pip install -U discord.py


## Some Function and Commands:
- hello + Names
- clear + A Number: delete a number of messages in the channel
- game: lauch a 2 player tic-tac-toe game with instructions
- meme: send a random Memes using meme-api.herokuapp.com


I'm still working on many more functions to add to my bot.

Thanks for reading
